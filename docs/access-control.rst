Screen Tokens
=============

Screen tokens allow non-human access to the UI to support permanent dashboards on TV screens.

On your local machine: authenticate via OAuth redirect flow and go to /screen-tokens to create a new token.
Write down the screen token on a piece of paper.

Go to the TV screen and enter /screen/$TOKEN in the location bar.
